Hi Keith! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who graduated from a Cal Poly. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who has a parent who is the sibling of a maternal grandparent of the bride or groom. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!
