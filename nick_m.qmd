Hi Nick! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who has owned a pair of fins for boogie boarding. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who enjoys a water sport involving a board. There are 4 other people with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them all!
