Hi Dan! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who was a schoolteacher for many years. There are 2 other people with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them all!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who has backpacked with Ian in the Sierras. There are 11 other people with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them all!
