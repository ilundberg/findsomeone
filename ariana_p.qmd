Hi Ariana! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who has lived in Claremont while working at Caltech. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who lives in the Bay Area and is the partner of someone who lived in Quincy House. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!
