Hi Susan! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who has camped with Ian's family. There are 3 other people with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them all!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who has backpacked with Ian in the Sierras. There are 8 other people with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them all!
