Hi Rachel! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who is or has been a medical resident in the state of Michigan. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who has backpacked with Ian in the Sierras. There are 8 other people with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them all!
