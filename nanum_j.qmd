Hi Nanum! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who has been training to run a race in the LA area. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who is a student at an institution where a Professor Lundberg works. There are 2 other people with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them all!
