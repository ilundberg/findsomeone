Hi Daniel! You have **two goals** in this game.

Your **first goal** is to find someone who is passionate about biology and science education. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!

Your **second goal** is to find someone who will be a student at USC this spring. There is 1 other person with this clue (and perhaps others who could have had this clue). See if you can find them!
